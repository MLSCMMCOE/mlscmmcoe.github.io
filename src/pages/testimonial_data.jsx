        testimonial: "I recently participated in the Microsoft Learner's Student Club (MLSC) program on GitHub and Azure Cloud. The program was well-organized and informative, and the instructors were knowledgeable and engaging. I learned a lot about these two popular technologies, and I am confident that the skills I acquired will be valuable in my future career. One of the highlights of the program was the question-and-answer session. The instructors asked a few challenging questions, but I was able to answer them correctly and win a free LinkedIn premium voucher for 1 year. This was a great way to test my knowledge and get rewarded for my efforts. Overall, I had a very positive experience at the MLSC program.",
